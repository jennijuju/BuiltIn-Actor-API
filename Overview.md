# Lotus Built-In APIs

Built-in actors are a set of protocol actors integrated into the Fielcoin protocol, providing features around storage, market, miner, etc. In order to use those features of the Filecoin network, FVM actors (aka. smart contracts) need to interact with built-in actors via their exported API. This API docs intend to provide information about how to use those exported APIs in user-defined actors.
